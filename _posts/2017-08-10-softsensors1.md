## Crush sensor.  
Originally this sensor was going to be a flex sensor but seems to make a better crush sensor. need to figure out if it is digital or analog output.

### Wire connection
The wires on This sensor are connected by first making a hook with single core wire and then stitching onto the conductive fabric. Multi stand wire is too floppy and wouldn't have a strong enough physical connection. It would be good to look into better ways of stitching wire.

### Wire connection
The wires are connected by soldering. This tended to melt the fabric and thus not an easy or strong way to make a connection. Is there a better way to solder it?
