## Eggs layed out and dried in preperation to blend
Still looking for ways to blend it up. Mortar and Pestal or might buy a small blender. WIll update.
## Wood Bioplastic test and result. 
Are most successful wood bioplastic was done by a 2 part mold that was clamped shut with tape. Pictures are shown as above. The bottom half however didnt dry as quickly so had to flip half way. Good results as the product didnt show as much cracking or curlaged.
