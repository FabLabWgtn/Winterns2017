Kia Ora Koutou

My name is Kimi Whiting and I am currently a full time student at Massey University studying Industrial Design. I have recently come back from an exchange abroad in Scotland and am back and ready to rumble. At the moment my areas of interest are user design, exhibition design, and interactive design.
In my spare time I do a lot of painting, drawing and cooking. However my interests change from week to week so you'll find I do a bit of everything.
