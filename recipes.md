### Custard Recipe Test (Using left over ingredients)

25mL Glycerol

100mL Vinegar (white)

600mL Water

5 grams Agar

45.5 grams Custard Powder

Method: Measure out all ingredients and add one by one to a pot. Simmer for on a low heat for 2mins then gradually move it up to a high heat. You will know when the mixture is ready when everything looks dissolved and semi translucent. This recipe doesn't have to much thickness so don't worry if its not like super gluggy, it'll dry within a few minutes and develop a thickness. Pour into pre oiled molds and let dry for up to 2 days , you can try air drying or in the oven at 20 degrees - or + 10 degrees.

NOTE: 
-We recommend you dissolve the agar ( in hot water)and custard powder (in cold water) seperately before combining together and with the rest of the ingredients.

-Also because it is custard powder it will have a weird yellow tinge. Super weird looking and not that appealing. We are lookin at just taking away the custard powder option and just sticking with cornflour.

### 3rd Recipe Test (Altered Corn recipe from analysis of first two recipes):

600mL WATER

100mL vinegar (white)

25mL glycerol 100% BP (decrese due to reading online about recipe calling for 1% solution of glycerol)

97g cornflour

***

### Mix 1 - 22:1 ratio

220 grams biosplastic mix

10 grams plywood shaving from the shopbot

NOTE:
-Might have worked better if we had soaked the wood prior.This recipe cracked a lot and became very delicate.

***

### Mix 2 - 111:9 ratio

555 grams bioplastic mix

45 grams plywood shaving from the shopbot

NOTE:
-A lot stronger,however is more of a wood composite then a bio plastic. Our best sample for this one was when we clamped two halves together then let dry in oven then about a day later opened it and let it dry with one side off ( in the oven on low for 2days, flipping mid way to dry evenly) this process made it keep form better and dry flat.

***

### Mix 3 - 22:3 ratio

22 grams bioplastic mix

3 grams wax shavings from CNC mill

Method: Make a bioplastic mix and add your wax shavings, pour into a mold. Will dry within 1-2 days at about 20 degrees in a oven.

NOTE:
-Super weird material, not worth trialing as it did'nt show that much potential. Just made the wax shavings stick together.

### 2nd Recipe Test (Corn recipe):

700mL water

100mL vinegar (white)

50mL glycerol 100% BP

97 g Cornflour

NOTE: 
-Some pieces harden quicker then others. Still hasn't completely dried. More potential in testing this recipe than the first. With some tweaking it could potentially become a lot more workable.

***

### 1st recipe test (Agar recipe):

240 ml of cold water

2 Tbsp agar flakes

14g glycerol 100% BP

NOTE: 
-Is a very wet mixture and did'nt dry properly.Broke easily. In this recipe we did use alot of agar so the mixture became very soft.
