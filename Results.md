|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------- :|
| Shrinkage | A fair amount, as it shrunk it cracked a lot into pieces | Massive amount of shrinkage, breaking apart, possibley due to the water vs wood content | Huge shrinkage both horizontally and vertically | Fair amount of shrinkage. Minimal cracking | Small amount of shrinkage and surface cracking but no cracks right through | Less shrinkage down than in, no cracking | Shrunk down rather than in, some cracking |
| Colour | Light brown due to saw dust, colour lightened as drying | As other | As other | Darker brown colouration, higher wood content, colour lightened as drying | As other | As other | Same colour as when put in sample, light blue |
| Curlage | So much that when it curled it cracked and broke apart, this could be due to the thin consistency | A lot of curlage, curled around itself and the cracks in it | Not as much curlage, possibly due to shape of mold | Not as much shrinkage across this mix due to water content. Curled at ends more than edges | Bowed a lot, max curlage of mix | Not as much curlage, again, possibly due to mold shape | Nearly no curlage, held shape well | 
| Hardness | Very hard, cracks when bent | As other | As other | Hardness comparitive to cardboard | Harder due to thinkness, distinctive "donk" noise | As other | 
| Weight | From 61 grams to 13 grams when dry. 48 gram weight loss | From 89.5 grams to 17.5 grams when dry. 72 gram loss | From 28 grams to 6 grams when dry. 22 gram loss | From 36 grams to 8.5 grams. 27.5 gram loss | From 116 grams to 28 grams when dry. 88 gram loss | From 33.5 grams to 8.5 grams when dry. 25 gram loss | From 25 grams to 4.5 grams. 20.5 gram loss |
| Flexibility | Not a lot as tends to crack when flexed | As other | As other | Minimal flexibility but has elasticity and springs back to shape | Nearly no movement in the sample | As Mix 2: Sample 2 | Flexible but prone to cracking where exposed to the air |
| Drying | Straight into a 23 degree oven and dried for 72 hours | As Mix 1: Sample 1 | As Mix 1: Sample 1 | As Mix 1: Sample 1 | As Mix 1: Sample 1 | As Mix 1: Sample 1 | As Mix 1: Sample 1 |

| Analysis Elements | Agar sample 1 | Agar sample 2 | Agar sample 3 | Corn sample 1 | Corn sample 2 | Corn sample 3 |
|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------- :|
| Shrinkage | Massive. Original 56 x 65 mm shrunk to 40 x 50mm | Minimal shrinkage | None | Unable to measure as samples are all of different sizes and shrinkage. Approx 10mm shrinkage with curlage | Originally 65 x 155mm, now 43.3 x 110 | Originally 65 x 155mm, now 41 x 101mm |
| Colour | Yellowed. Semi-opaque | Reasonably clear, still yellowy hue | Very transparent | Originally opaque white, then yellowed and became more transparent | From white to yellowy and transparent | Similar to sample 2. Slightly more transparent |
| Curlage | Not a lot. Curled more at corners | None until taken from mold | None until taken from mold | A lot, flat when molded. Also bowed in different directions | Very curly, came up at ends more | Curled a lot. Also cracked and curled along the cracks |
| Hardness | Squishy. Harder on edges exposed to air | Like jelly, quite sticky | Very soft, like gladwrap, sticking to itself | Quite hard, able to be snapped or cracked | Hard on edges, soft in middle | Not as hard as sample 2. Edges very crispy |
| Weight | 19.5 grams post drying | 4 grams post drying | 2.5 grams post drying | 1.5 - 2.5 grams after drying | 19 grams | 16 grams |
| Flexibility | Very flexible without breaking. Not stretchy | Very flexible but tears easily | Incredibly flexible but sticks to itself | Cracks on outside. Soft and flexible in the middle | Doesn't crack but resistant to flexing | Still quite flexible, cacked when touched after 24 hours |
| Drying | Left over night then dried at 23 degrees for 72 hours. Needs more drying | As sample 1 | As sample 1 | Left overnight then dried at 23 degrees for 72 hours. Needs more drying | As sample 1, flipped after 24 hours | Left out to dry for all of the time others were in oven |
