<h1>Winterns</h1>
<h4>Winterns is an internship project at Fab Lab Wgtn. We are working on making bio-plastics for multiple uses in design.We are also looking into developing soft sensors for future workshops and design uses.</h4>

<h2>Bioplastics</h2>
<h4>Looking to develop a bio plastic that could be used in many mediums of design. At the moment we are looking into food, packaging, apparel, and acessories as maybe final products for our most successful bioplastic. We will be documenting our finds through tables, photos and weekly blog posts.</h4>

<h2>Soft Sensors</h2>
<h4>For the soft sensors we are looking to possible make arduinos a part of the process. To fully understand soft sensors we will be playing around with the different variations of them and constantly experimenting with making our own personalised ones. Through our research and experimentation there is the potential to hold workshops for other students to gain the same knowledge we have in our internship.</h4>
